  14: "is a earthy, edgy shade for nights out in your urban locale and the subsequent two mile walk home because your non-profit salary doesn't have room for $19 ubers",
  21: "is a perfect color to wear on your beach trip to floridian cities ravaged by the covid-19 pandemic when you are on vacation after getting your vaccine in april. wear with or without a mask and this look will certainly draw wandering eyes.",
  22: "is a shade to honor our heroes of tik tok, bravely facing the social world. wear this color along a longboard (or pennyboard if you're 20), drinking ocean spray cut with a few splashes of vodka",
  23: "is a friendly spring blue reminiscent of fresh water by a cabin your parents used to drag you to as a child that you never appreciated, unaware that the world had potential for so much worse",
  24: "is the color of americana's favourite soon-to-bee-extinct species, the bumblebee. a great color for enjoying spring days while they still exist, before climate cataclysm takes us all"
